My work experience has given me a comprehensive knowledge of clinical trials, statistics, research methodologies, healthcare terminologies such as ICD-10, lecturing, communication with stakeholders - NGOs - governmental agencies and writing detailed reports. I am proficient in Python, MySQL, and SPSS to implement statistical analyses, machine learning models, data cleansing and EDA. 
 
Playing around data, creating hypotheses, testing these hypotheses and building a machine learning model, and learning new concepts each day is something that really makes me excited.
