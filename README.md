- About me :

A physical therapist who had his MSc and PhD in Occupational Therapy; and has been working in Hacettepe University since 2010 as a researcher. 

In the course of being a researcher in health sciences, I gained experience conducting my own research, and implement related statistics in SPSS. 
Most of the analyses I conducted were A/B testing, correlation analyses, multivariant analysis, principal component analysis with SPSS and 
structural equation modelling with AMOS. 

The interest I grew in statistics, made me work on Python and data science basics. since 2018 I've been studying these concepts and analysing public data.  
Playing around data, creating hypotheses, testing these hypotheses and building a machine learning model, and learning new concepts each day is something that really makes me excited. 

Therefore, I might say that I am a self-taught data science enthusiast, and willing to make a transition into the data science field.
