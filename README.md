# Hi there, I'm Orkun Tahir ARAN, PhD. 👋

### 🧬 Clinical Data Scientist | Associate Professor of Occupational Therapy

I bridge the gap between **Clinical Health Sciences** and **Data Science**. 

As an Associate Professor with over 15 years of experience in rehabilitation and research, I don't just analyze numbers; I understand the *clinical story* behind the data. I specialize in transforming complex healthcare datasets into publishable insights and actionable models.

### 🔬 Key Interest Areas & Domain Expertise

Based on my clinical background and publications, I apply data science to solve complex problems in:

## 🚗 Driver Safety & Telematics Analytics:

Analyzing driving simulator data to predict Fitness-to-Drive for elderly and disabled populations.

Modeling the correlation between cognitive tests and driving errors (reaction time, lane deviation) using regression models.

Reference: Experienced in analyzing data from high-fidelity driving simulators for risk assessment.

## 🤖 Clinical Machine Learning:

Developing predictive models for Vestibular Disorders (BPPV) to determine treatment outcomes and maneuver counts.

Using Classification Algorithms (Random Forest, SVM) to support clinical decision-making systems.

Paper Highlight: "Predictive modeling of maneuver numbers in BPPV therapy using machine learning (2025)."

## 📊 Psychometrics & Instrument Validation:

Advanced statistical validation of clinical assessment tools (Factor Analysis, Cronbach's Alpha, ROC/AUC Analysis).

Cross-cultural adaptation and reliability testing of health scales (e.g., Autism Activity Card Sort, Stroke Rehabilitation Profile).

Designing rigorous data collection protocols for clinical trials.

## 📐 Ergonomics & Anthropometric Data Analysis:

Processing large-scale anthropometric datasets to evaluate human-environment fit (e.g., school furniture suitability).

Statistical analysis of physical dimensions for Occupational Health & Safety interventions.

## 🧠 Neurological Rehabilitation Analytics:

Quantifying recovery trajectories in Stroke and Cerebral Palsy patients using longitudinal data analysis.

Analyzing the efficacy of Virtual Reality (VR) interventions on motor function through sensor data.
